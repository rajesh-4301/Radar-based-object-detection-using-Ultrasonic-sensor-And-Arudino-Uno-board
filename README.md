# Radar-based-object-detection-using-Ultrasonic-sensor-And-Arudino-Uno-board
This project involves designing a radar-based object detection system using an Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) and an Arduino Uno to detect obstacles in a specified range. The system simulates radar functionality by continuously scanning the environment and identifying objects based on the time delay of ultrasonic waves.
